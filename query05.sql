-- Question 5

--Rate neighborhoods by their bus stop accessibility for wheelchairs. Use Azavea's neighborhood dataset from OpenDataPhilly along with an appropriate dataset from the Septa GTFS bus feed. Use the GTFS documentation for help. Use some creativity in the metric you devise in rating neighborhoods.

--Discuss your accessibility metric and how you arrived at it below.

--Here, my final index for accessibility is comprised of two different metricsâ€”the average distance from any given point in the neighbourhood to the closest accessible bus stop, and the density of accessible bus stops per km2 within the neighbourhood.
--Accessibility here to me means that a person with disability would not need to travel very far to reach a bus stop with accessible options.
--To create my index, I first calculate the average distance and density measure. To calculate my average distance, I first create a grid of randomly distributed points using the st_generatepoints function.
--these grid points will be my starting distance for the average distance calculation.
--My measurement for density measured the total number of accessible bus stops over the entire area of the neighbourhood. I use density rather than proportion here because distance is my most important value to reduce in an accessible neighbourhood.
--I normalize my measures so they can be situated around 1.

--workflow: join bus stop information to neighbourhood shapes. Create a random grid layer that contains dots across all of the neighbourhood. Find the average nearest neighbour distance to any one bus stop, also calculate accessible bus stop by sq meter in the neighbourhood.
