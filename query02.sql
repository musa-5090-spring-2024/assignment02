  Which eight bus stops have the smallest population above 500 people _inside of Philadelphia_ within 800 meters of the stop (Philadelphia county block groups have a geoid prefix of `42101` -- that's `42` for the state of PA, and `101` for Philadelphia county)?

        estimated_pop_800m integer, -- The population within 800 meters
        geog geography -- The geography of the bus stop
