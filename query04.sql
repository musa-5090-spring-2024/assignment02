/*
Using the `bus_shapes`, `bus_routes`, and `bus_trips` tables from GTFS bus feed,
find the **two** routes with the longest trips.

    _Your query should run in under two minutes._

    >_**HINT**: The `ST_MakeLine` function is useful here. You can see an example
    of how you could use it at [this MobilityData walkthrough]
    (https://docs.mobilitydb.com/MobilityDB-workshop/master/ch04.html#:~:text=INSERT%20INTO%20shape_geoms)
    on using GTFS data. If you find other good examples, please share them in Slack._

    >_**HINT**: Use the query planner (`EXPLAIN`) to see if there might be opportunities to s
    peed up your query with indexes. For reference, I got this query to run in about 15 seconds._

    >_**HINT**: The `row_number` window function could also be useful here. You can read more
    about window functions [in the PostgreSQL documentation]
    (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/tutorial-window.html). That documentation page
    uses the `rank` function, which is very similar to `row_number`. For more info about window functions you can check out:_
