/*Using the bus_shapes, bus_routes, and bus_trips tables from GTFS bus feed, find the two routes with 
the longest trips.

Your query should run in under two minutes.

HINT: The ST_MakeLine function is useful here. You can see an example of how you could use it at 
this MobilityData walkthrough on using GTFS data. If you find other good examples, please share them in Slack.

HINT: Use the query planner (EXPLAIN) to see if there might be opportunities to speed up your query with indexes. 
For reference, I got this query to run in about 15 seconds.

HINT: The row_number window function could also be useful here. You can read more about window functions in 
the PostgreSQL documentation. That documentation page uses the rank function, which is very similar to row_number. 
For more info about window functions you can check out:
