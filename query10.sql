/* You're tasked with giving more contextual information to rail stops to fill the stop_desc field 
in a GTFS feed. Using any of the data sets above, PostGIS functions (e.g., ST_Distance, ST_Azimuth, etc.), 
and PostgreSQL string functions, build a description (alias as stop_desc) for each stop. 
Feel free to supplement with other datasets (must provide link to data used so it's reproducible), 
and other methods of describing the relationships. SQL's CASE statements may be helpful for some 
operations.

Structure:
(
    stop_id integer,
    stop_name text,
    stop_desc text,
    stop_lon double precision,
    stop_lat double precision
)

As an example, your stop_desc for a station stop may be something like "37 meters NE of 1234 Market St" 
(that's only an example, feel free to be creative, silly, descriptive, etc.)
